The Requirement of Official and Commercial Evidence under the Indirect Export of Goods.

As per provisions of Article 30.2 of Cabinet Decision No. 52 of 2017 on the Executive Regulations of the Federal  Decree-law No. 8 of 2017 on Value Added Tax in the UAE, an indirect export of Goods from an implementing state ( which include UAE ) to overseas customer shall be subject to VAT at the rate of 0% (Zero percent) only if the prescribed conditions are fulfilled.

As set forth in the Article 4.a and 4.b of the aforementioned law and to ensure our compliance with the regulatory requirements, we would require the Official and Commercial evidence documents of export of goods within 45 days from our date of supply of goods. In case of failure in doing so, Mapei will not benefit of the tax rate of zero percent applicable for the indirect export of goods and therefore will be required to reverse the initial Tax Invoice issued at the rate of 0% VAT and issue a new Tax Invoice with the standard rate applicable at 5% VAT. The customer acknowledges and agrees that it will accept the revised invoice and be obliged to remit the VAT amount to Mapei in view of the regulatory requirement.

The Official evidence means Export documents issued by the local Emirate Customs Department in respect of Goods leaving the State including Exit certificate from the customs authorities.

The Commercial evidence shall include any the following:

a.      Airway bill.
b.      Bill of lading.
c.      Consignment note.
d.      Certificate of shipment.

The evidence obtained as proof of Export, whether official or commercial, must identify the following;

a.      The Supplier.
b.      The Consignor.
c.      The Goods.
d.      The Value.
e.      The Export destination.
f.      The mode of transport and route of the export movement.

Note:

The Requirement of Official and Commercial Evidence under the Indirect Export of Goods.

As per provisions of Article 30.2 of Cabinet Decision No. 52 of 2017 on the Executive Regulations of the Federal  Decree-law No. 8 of 2017 on Value Added Tax in the UAE, an indirect export of Goods from an implementing state ( which include UAE ) to overseas customer shall be subject to VAT at the rate of 0% (Zero percent) only if the prescribed conditions are fulfilled.

As set forth in the Article 4.a and 4.b of the aforementioned law and to ensure our compliance with the regulatory requirements, we would require the Official and Commercial evidence documents of export of goods within 45 days from our date of supply of goods. In case of failure in doing so, Mapei will not benefit of the tax rate of zero percent applicable for the indirect export of goods and therefore will be required to reverse the initial Tax Invoice issued at the rate of 0% VAT and issue a new Tax Invoice with the standard rate applicable at 5% VAT. The customer acknowledges and agrees that it will accept the revised invoice and be obliged to remit the VAT amount to Mapei in view of the regulatory requirement.

The Official evidence means Export documents issued by the local Emirate Customs Department in respect of Goods leaving the State including Exit certificate from the customs authorities.

The Commercial evidence shall include any the following:

u.      Airway bill.
v.      Bill of lading.
w.      Consignment note.
x.      Certificate of shipment.

The evidence obtained as proof of Export, whether official or commercial, must identify the following;

ae.     The Supplier.
af.     The Consignor.
ag.     The Goods.
ah.     The Value.
ai.     The Export destination.
aj.     The mode of transport and route of the export movement.
