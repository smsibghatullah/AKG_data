Dear Mr. Babar,

Please be advised that, following careful evaluation of the desired price reduction, the price of Adesilex P7 Grey will now be AED0.55/kg instead of AED0.59/kg, provided that we are able to acquire order of 4,200 bags on average per month. Up until the end of June 2024, we will be tracking the trend. If the goal is not met, the price will return to what it was before the discount.



We hope that the above will suffice your requirement.



Thank you.



Best Regards

Dear Bachir,



I trust this email finds you well. As per discussion with Mr. Jehad, I am writing to discuss the pricing of the P7 Grey, and we would like to request a reconsideration for a price adjustment.



As you are aware, we have been closely monitoring our operational costs, especially those related to warehousing, handling, and deliveries. Unfortunately, these costs have been increasing, and we find ourselves facing additional financial pressure in managing the logistics of the P7 Grey.



Considering these challenges, we kindly request your assistance in decreasing the price of the P7 Grey. A reduction in the product cost would greatly alleviate the financial burden we are currently experiencing in the areas mentioned above. We believe that a mutually beneficial adjustment in pricing would enhance our partnership and contribute to the continued success of both our businesses.



We understand that pricing decisions are carefully considered, and we appreciate your attention to this matter. If necessary, we are open to scheduling a meeting to discuss this further and provide any additional information that may assist in reaching a favorable resolution.



Thank you for your understanding and cooperation. We value our partnership and look forward to your positive response.



Best regards,
